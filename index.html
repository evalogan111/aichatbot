                    <p>Sarah Davidson is the owner of a mid-sized ecommerce brand that specializes in Eco-friendly home
                        goods. She switched her customer support system to Chatbase AI. When she did it, she did not
                        expect that the <a href="https://www.chatbase.co/" target="_blank">AI customer service</a> agent would transform her business entirely. But within just
                        18 months, she was surprised to see that more than 12 million additional reviews brought down
                        support costs by 60% and scaled her functions without hiring a single additional agent. </p>

                    <p>So, you might wonder how she did it. The purpose of this blog is to break down the strategy that
                        turned a growing small business into a scalable success story: </p>
                    <h2>The Turning Point: Too Many Tickets, Not Sufficient Time</h2>
                    <p>Before Chatbase, Sarah’s small support team was drowning in queries from customers. From order
                        tracking and returns to product queries, her small team struggled to keep up, particularly
                        during the holidays and product launches. Long response times led to abandoned carts, poor
                        reviews, and repeat customers slipping away. </p>
                    <p>She started realizing that her business is losing money simply because her team could not respond
                        quickly enough. She started thinking that her business needs a solution that would not simply
                        answer questions but could learn and adapt with customers. </p>
                    <p>At this time, she discovered Charbase AI, an intelligent customer service platform designed
                        particularly for growing businesses. </p>
                    <h2>The Strategy: Automate, Personalize and Optimize</h2>
                    <h3>Automating 80% of Queries from Customers</h3>
                    <p>This business owner started by training Chatbase’s AI Agent on her articles from the existing
                        help centre. Also, she provided the past support conversations and product manuals to train the
                        AI agent. Within weeks, the AI agent started handling order status enquiries, return policies,
                        and FAQS. Most importantly, the AI agent started handling basic troubleshooting guides, which
                        made up nearly 80% of all incoming tickets. </p>
                    <p>As the AI started taking over the things mentioned above, Sarah’s human agents were freed to pay
                        attention to complex issues. Also, they have a lot of time to focus on VIP customers. As a
                        result, the quality of resolution improved, and customers from across the board were satisfied.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Personalization Without Extra Headcount</h3>
                    <p>The natural language processing ability of Chatbase and its CRM integration permitted the AI
                        agent to customize conversations in real time. The AI agent started to greet customers by name.
                        Also, it started referring to the order history of customers. Further, it began to recommend
                        products based on customer preferences. </p>
                    <p>Customers and prospective customers of Sarah’s business started feeling that they were talking to
                        a human agent, as the responses they got were so relevant and helpful. </p>
                    <h3>24/7 Global Support Instantly</h3>
                    <p>Sarah’s eCommerce business had customers from across the world. For instance, she had customers
                        from Australia, the UK, and the US. So, she found it hard to manage time zones. However, after
                        she switched to Charbase, her business was able to provide round-the-clock support to customers.
                        Above all, this became possible without hiring global staff. As a result, the cart abandonment
                        rate was reduced by nearly half, and conversion rates during off-hours considerably increased
                        for the e-commerce business. </p>
                    <p>In short, with Chatbase, Sarah was able to save both time and money. As a result, she was able to
                        focus more on growing her business and achieved great heights. </p>
